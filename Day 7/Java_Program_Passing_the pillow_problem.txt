Problem :

There are n people standing in a line labeled from 1 to n. The first person in the line is holding a pillow initially. Every second, the person holding the pillow passes it to the next person standing in the line. Once the pillow reaches the end of the line, the direction changes, and people continue passing the pillow in the opposite direction.

For example, once the pillow reaches the nth person they pass it to the n-1th person, then to the n-2th person and so on.

given the two positive integers n and time, return the index of the person holding the pillow after time seconds.

Example 1 : 

Input : n=4, time=5
Output: 2
Explanation: People pass the pillow in the following way :1-> 2-> 3-> 4-> 3-> 2.

After five seconds, the 2nd person is holding the pillow.

Solution in Java :
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
import java.util.*;

public class MyClass {
    
    static int indexWithPillow(int n, int t){

        int res=1;
        // total number of passes would be p
        int p = n-1;
            
            if(t<n){
                res=t+1;
            }
            else
            if(t==n){
                res=t-1;
            }
            else
            if(t>n){
                
                int d=t/p;
                int r=t%p;
                
                if(d%2 == 0){
                    
                    res+=r;
                }
                else{
                    res=n-r;
                }
            }
        
        return res;
    }
    
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        
      // Declare an array with 0 values in between
        
      int n=4, time=5;
      
      System.out.println("Given number of Peaople are :"+ n);
      System.out.println("Given number of time pillow is passed :"+ time);
      
      int result= indexWithPillow(n,time);

      System.out.println("Index of person with pillow is = " + result);
      
    }
}
